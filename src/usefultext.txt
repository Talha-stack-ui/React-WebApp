Features & details
【Lithium Ion Technology】: entrox deep cycle lithium ion batteries have exceptional longevity since they manufacturing by Automotive Grade Li-ion Cells with higher energy density, more stable performance & greater power, letting you use the battery more freely. Our batteries are more cost effective, so when factoring time and cost into your purchase, our lithium iron battery banks come out ahead every time
【Longer Service Life & Higher Safety】: Our Li-ion 26650 battery provides 1500-1800 cycles (4 times longer) & a 10-year lifetime compared to 300~500 cycles & a 3-year lifetime in lead acid battery. Highest-level safety based on UL Testing Certificate for the cell inside the battery pack.
【Lightweight & Versatile】: Weighting only 13kgs for one module, our 72V 20Ah battery weighs in at only 1/4 the weight of lead acid batteries! With no acid in the battery, you're able to safely mount in any position. This makes li-ion batteries perfect for marine, RV, campers, golf cart, medical devices, motorhomes & electric mobility scooter, off-road and off-grid applications!
【Efficient Power& Capacity Expansion】: entrox Li-ion battery’s flat discharge curve holds above 60V for up to 90% of its capacity usage, providing astronomical boosts in run-time compared to only 50% in Lead Acid. The battery can be connected in parallel and series for large capacity. Connect in Series and parallel: Up to 20series and 4parallel(total 80) identical batteries for up to 72V; This product is your best choice for outdoor camping power and indoor easy installation;
【Built-In BMS & Convenience & Maintenance Free】: Our Li-ion battery has built-in BMS (Battery Management System) to protect it from overcharge, over-discharge, over-current, and short circuit with excellent self-discharge rate. Built-in high /low-temp cut off prevents charging over 122 °F (50 °C)/under 32 °F (0 °C). Li-ion battery is 70% lighter than lead acid battery with the same capacity. Without memory effect, no matter what state the battery is, it can be used as soon as it is charged.
